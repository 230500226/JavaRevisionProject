# Java Revision Project

This is a Java revision project by the Blue Print Bandits team. The project consists of four applications: a login page, a scientific calculator, a currency converter, and a calendar. The project is intended to help us practice our Java skills and prepare for the final exam.
##Requirements

    Java 11 or higher
    No external libraries required

## Usage

To run the project, clone the repository and open it in your preferred IDE. Then, run the Main.java file in the src folder.

The login page will ask you for your username and password. The default credentials are:

    Username: Admin
    Password: Admin123

After logging in, you will see a menu page where you can choose which application to launch.
Applications

## The project includes the following applications:

    Scientific Calculator: A calculator that can perform basic and advanced mathematical operations, such as trigonometry, logarithms, and exponentiation.
    Currency Converter: A converter that can convert between different currencies, such as USD, EUR, GBP, and ZAR. The converter uses the latest exchange rates from the European Central Bank.
    Calendar: A calendar that can display the current date and time, as well as events and reminders. The calendar can also calculate the number of days between two dates.
    Stop Watch: A stop watch that can measure the elapsed time in seconds, minutes, and hours. The stop watch can also pause, resume, and reset.

## Responsibilities

The Blue Print Bandits team members have divided the work as follows:

    Sam and Snowyru will work on the Scientific Calculator and the Login Page.
    Chrinovic and Mandisa will work on the Calendar.
    Carnifex will work on the Stop Watch.
    Marcos will work on the Currency Converter.

We will communicate and collaborate with each other using GitHub issues, pull requests, and comments. We will also have regular meetings to discuss our progress and challenges.

Please note that this division of work is subject to change depending on the availability and preferences of the team members. We will update this section accordingly if there are any changes.
